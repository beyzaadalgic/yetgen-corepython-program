YetGen's Core Python Program aims to teach Python skills from beginner to intermediate-advanced level to students who have graduated from YetGen's Basic education. 
YetGen Core Python Education Program, prepared by YetGen; 12-week program supported by live lectures and question resolution sessions with YetGen leaders on topics such as Introduction to Python and Git, Python Fundamentals, Conditional Statements, Data Structures, Functions, Libraries , Error Handling , File Operations , Object Oriented Programming, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
